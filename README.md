Mark One Laboratory Extensions (M.O.L.E.)

Are your Mk1 command pods gathering dust? Wish you had a space station earlier in your career? Then the Mark One Laboratory Extensions (MOLE) are for you! Give your Mk1 command pod a new lease on life by adding a back seat module for an additional kerbal. Add a docking tunnel system with integrated RCS and parachute to making rendezvous and docking easier. With the Station Service Module, you’ll have additional life support (TAC-LS and Kerbal Snacks compatible), electrical power, and monopropellant. Add a Mark One Laboratory Extension for your experiments, and/or a DenEye Space Telescope for uh- astronomy! Yeah, that’s it!
MOLE is a stand-alone parts pack with optional support for TAC Life Support, Kerbal Snacks, CactEye Telescope System, and Multipurpose Colony Modules.

Real World Inspiration

Back in the 1960s, the USAF has a military space program, and one of its projects was the Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL). MOL was designed as a spy satellite (KH-10 Dorian) disguised as a military research station. One of the cool things about it is that the Gemini spacecraft was already attached to the station when it launched. The Air Force flew a mockup into orbit once, but then the program was cancelled.

	//(Required) description of the experiment
	description = Sponsored by the DStaal Institute of Technology (DIT), this experiment will test various construction methods to see what works and what doesn't on the surfaces of other worlds. The results of this experiment will determine how future craft will be built and maintained for exploration and colonization of those worlds.

	RESULTS
	{
		default = We managed to make a concrete slab type thing.  Mostly.
	    	MunSrfLanded = Mun dust can be compacted to make a fairly effective concrete analog.  It might be useful in making bases.
		MunSrfLanded = The upper layers of the Mun's surface - while geologically stable - appear to shift randomly with the day/night cycle.  Care should be taken when placing structures on the surface to place them on as level a field as possible.
		MunSrfLanded = Building a base on the Mun is definitely possible.
		KerbinSrfLanded = We have successfully learned how to build on Kerbin.
		KerbinSrfLanded = You know, we didn't really need an air-tight rocket capable of going into space to do this.
		KerbinSrfLanded = Kerbin's surface actually makes a pretty poor building material.  To much organic matter.
		KerbinSrfLandedTundra = Cutting up the ground appears to make a good building material.  Until it heats up.
		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = Igloos are the future.
		KerbinSrfSplashed = The local surface material is very difficult to turn into solid building material.  Maybe we'd have more luck in space?

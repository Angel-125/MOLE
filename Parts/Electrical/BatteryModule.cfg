	description = When it became apparent that stations would run out of power on the night side of their orbits, Wild Blue Industries bought several off-sized surplus z500 batteries and wired them into a cylindrical chassis. The end result is a giant battery pack capable of holding a large charge. The Power Module team got jealous, and now both teams regularly face off in vigours badminton matches.

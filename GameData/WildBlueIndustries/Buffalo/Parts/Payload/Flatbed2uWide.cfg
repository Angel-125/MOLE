	description = The Standard Flatbed is mounted to the Buffalo Chassis. The 2u simplifies construction a bit by doubling the length of the flatbed. It provides six hardpoints to mount a variety of equipment such as the Buckboard and Ponderosa. While you need an engineer to attach the flatbed to the chassis, you don't need one to stack equipment.

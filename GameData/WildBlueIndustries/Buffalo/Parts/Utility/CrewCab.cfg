	description = The Buffalo Crew Cabin provides mobile living quarters for two kerbals. The facilities are pretty spartan, and the crew have to rearrange the furnature to take care of their basic necessities. It still beats the confines of the Buffalo Command Cab, and smells better too. The cabin also doubles as a small geo-survey lab once technology advances enough.

	RESULTS
	{
		default = Soil samples suggest some kind of volcanic activity in the distant past.
		default = These core samples seem to have two different compositions that indicate that some resources come from asteroid impacts.
		default = The core sample was contaminated, but the surrounding landscape has an interesting tectonic history. Numerous cracks in the ground indicate several faults in the area.
		default = Layers of sedimentary rock in the core sample indicate that water once flowed in this area. Perhaps there is water in an underground aquifer.
		default = This core sample has hematite spherules, popularly known as "blueberries" throughout the strata. They also taste terrible when added to pancakes.
		default = You find perchlorate salt deposits in the core sample. Perhaps there is water somewhere else in the area.
		default = The core samples contain basalt along with traces of gypsum, kieserite, opaline silica, and phyllosilicates. This seems to be pretty common for this area.
		default = A core sample from this area has a high percentage of clay.
		default = There appear to be flecks of a strange blue substance in the core samples. Spectral analysis hasn't been able to identify the substance, and it glows in certain lights.
		default = A layer of iron oxide in the core samples of this area suggests that an asteroid impacted the area.
		default = Several core samples consist of volcanic rock, suggesting volcanic activity in this region.
		default = There are traces of gold in the core sample. Gold rush, anyone?
		default = Somebody ate the core sample, it looked like layered chocolate cake.
		default = The sample has precursor chemicals necessary for life to occur. Perhaps there is some kind of life somewhere else in the region?
		default = This unassuming core sample contains rock, soil, and dust- not unlike regolith!

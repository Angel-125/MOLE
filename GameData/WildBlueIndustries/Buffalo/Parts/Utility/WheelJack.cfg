	description = Not to be confused with a transforming robot that was voiced by a famous actor, the wheel jack serves as the foundation for building a Buffalo MSEV. Simply bolt it into the ground. If you can run into the wheel jack and move it, then it's not bolted properly. Once bolted firmly into the ground, attach a Buffalo Assembly Port to the WheelJack's top node (be sure that the Assembly Port's RED side is up). Then attach the chassis or other components to the Buffalo Assembly Port. Finally, to detach the assembled vehicle, switch to the space center and back to the rover, then decouple the Assembly Port.

	RESULTS
	{
		default = We've gained some more insight on how the kerbal body is affected by microgravity.
		KerbinInSpace = Results show a loss of muscle mass and strength, especially in the lower extremities.
		KerbinInSpace = Bone density appears to decrease with prolonged exposure to microgravity. Kerbals should exercise regularly to maintain their health.
		KerbinInSpace = Fluids tend to pool in the head and torso.
		KerbinInSpace = Researchers note a performance decrease in the cardiovascular system and a weakened immune system. Recommend regular exercise.
		KerbinInSpace = Kerbals prefer solid foods and ice cream to eating pastes from tubes.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = Increased levels of cellular damage is noted further from Kerbin's magnetosphere.  Increasing radiation shielding is recommended.  As a side note, Bill now glows slightly.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = High orbit does not appear to significantly change effects to bone and muscle density vs. low orbit.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = Kerbals like looking at the stars.  Could we get a window?

		MunSrfLanded = Muscle mass and strength loss is mitigated by the 0.166g gravitational field on Mun's surface.  But only slightly.
		MunSrfLanded = Researchers note an unexpected increase in performance of the cardiovascular system from living on the Mun.  As a side note, jumping in low gravity is fun.
		MunSrfLanded = A strange burning smell has been traced to the dust tracked in by returning EVAs.  Bob has advised everyone to not panic - it appears to be the scent of Mun dust, and does not mean there's an actual fire.

		MunInSpace = Tool design does not appear to be affected by what body we orbit.  The engineers refer you to the results from Kerbin orbit.
		MinmusInSpace = In a completely unexpected finding, orbiting Minmus appears to be the same as orbiting Kerbin for designing hammers.  There have been some interesting ideas for ice cream scoops though.
		MunSrfLanded = Screwdriver designs for the Mun appear to be much easier than for microgravity.  It has to do with Bill being able to put his feet on the ground.

		KerbinInSpace = These crystals can be used for some New Age thingy.
		KerbinInSpace = With enough R&D, an industry could be created around high-quality protein crystal growth.
		KerbinInSpace = This experiment failed to create crystals. Instead we got near-perfect spheres. Maybe a future study could create ballbearings in space.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = Crystals in space tend to be thinner and spikier than those grown closer to the planetary surface.
		MunSrfLanded = Crystals grown on beds of Munar regolith exhibit some fascinatingly unusual grow patterns.  Further research will be needed to see if they are useful for anything.
		MunSrfLanded = Mun's low gravity means that crystals grown on it's surface are very similar to crystals grown in space.  It might be worth setting up a production facility.

		default = Ice cream makes a great snack.
		KerbinInSpace = Ice cream needs to be stirred while freezing in order for the ingredients to mix properly. Kerbals need exercise to keep their bodies fit in microgravity. Why not combine the two?
		MunInSpace = Mun mud pie, just sayin.
		MinmusInSpace = Mixing ice cream in Minmus orbit immediately suggests making a mint-flavored ice cream.
		DunaInSpace = The rusty planet has a nice redish tint to it- perfect for a strawberry flavored ice cream.
		IkeInSpace = Ike Cream, get it?
		MohoInSpace = How about adding jalapenos to ice cream for a spicy aftertaste?
		EveInSpace = What does the sample taste like? How does it make you feel? What if you exercice while eating the ice cream? Quick, answer! So much pressure...
		JoolInSpace = We couldn't think of any good names for this new batch of ice cream. We'll have to consult Garcia Kerman.
		BopInSpace = We considered mixing in the blood of a kraken into the ice cream, but that's just gross.

		EelooInSpace = After looking at the window, you decide to add cookies and cream into the mixture.
		MinmusSrfLanded = The surface of Minmus is *not* repeat *not* made of ice cream.  On an unrelated note, does Jeb have that shipment of packaging equipment ready to send up yet?

		KerbinSrfSplashed = The presence of water seems to mitigate the day/night temperature shifts.
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = We expected the temperature to be remain very high, but it seems the desert cools off quite a bit at night.

		KerbinInSpace = Measuring the temperature of space appears to be very hard - we are getting the temperature of our ship, not the surrounding vacuum.
		KerbinInSpace = Temperature readings appear to be largely dependent on whether the thermometer is exposed to Kerbol at the time of the reading.
		KerbinInSpace = Experimental readings were disrupted by Bill trying to bake a cake.  Where he found an oven we're not sure.  The cake was delicious though.
		KerbinInSpace = Temperatures inside the ship are largely as set by the life support system.  Wait, you wanted us to measure the *outside* temperature changes?

		KerbinInSpace = Microgravity appears to cause some weird crystallization - the goo originally was one lump, but has broken up into thousands of tiny shards.  They appear to be damaging the interior of the container...
		KerbinInSpace = The goo appears to be liquid enough for surface tension to form it into a stable sphere.  Well, unless it gets bumped.  Then it wiggles a bit until it's a sphere again.  Um, what was that about learning about the formation of the Mun?

        KerbinInSpace = Cognitive function appears unimpaired.  The mouse beats Bill through the maze by a factor of 50%.
        KerbinInSpace = There was an issue with the glykerol feed during revival.  The mouse appears ok, despite that.

General health appears fine despite that, but further testing is warranted.

		SunFlyingLow = Everything is melting, including the electronicsssss.........

		MohoSrfLanded = The materials bay bakes in the heat of Moho's surface. It appears that trace elements are reacting to the samples contained within.
		MohoSrfLanded = You expose the samples to the high temperatures of Moho. A lot of them melt in really interesting ways.

		KerbinSrfLanded = The materials show little signs of change, though one of the samples appears to be judging you silently.
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = The desert dust appears to have contaminated all the samples. We did learn that deserts aren't a good place to bring expensive science equipment, though!
		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = The water sample has frozen solid and the goopy samples appear to be extra goopy.
		KerbinSrfLandedShores = The water spray has rusted one of the samples and some of the electronics ar&/F***13e5rse4t8st######
		KerbinSrfLandedWater = Everything has gotten really wet. One of the samples caught fire! Whoa!
		KerbinSrfLandedWater = Exposing the power source of the lab to water has proved to be rather... enlightening.
		KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = You expose the samples to the badlands of Kerbin, but worry that it may have a bad influence on them.
		KerbinFlyingLow = The less resilient samples appear to have splattered around the interior, forming new and interesting color combinations.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The rarified air has caused interesting changes to the gel samples. It seems like something is happening with the interior structure.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The micro gravity has greatly affected the growth of crystalline structures. Loose objects are also flying around the bay in a very messy but fascinating way.  

		MunSrfLanded = The fine dust of the Mun has intermixed with some of the samples. You have a sneaking suspicion that they'll never be able to get the lab clean again.
		MunSrfLanded = You leave the sample bay doors open on the Mun, and go do something else for a while.
		
		MinmusSrfLanded = While the material samples were processed, you began to turn your thoughts to how much Minmus looks like a mint dessert, and have discovered that you are now hungry.

		InSpace = The high radiation environment caused a few of the samples to glow. It looks like it would be fun to paint the rocket with this.

		EveSrfLanded = The crushing pressure of the atmosphere is causing some of the materials to crystallize rapidly.
		EveSrfLanded = You're not sure if most of the samples changed color, or if it's just the lighting...
		EveFlyingHigh = The extremely dense atmosphere strips the contents of the materials bay.
		EveFlyingLow = The atmosphere appears to either polish or strip the material, depending on its composition.

		GillySrfLanded = The samples appear to behave like they're in low orbit of Kerbin.
		GillySrfLanded = Some of the surface material has mixed with the contents of the bay. You write down the results for good measure.

		DunaSrfLanded = Opening the sample container you find that everything has turned red. Initial tests show that it'll never wash out of white space suits. You consider sending missions in pink EVA suits to reduce cleaning costs.
		DunaSrfLanded = The sample computer processes the results. It's massive red eye seems to be at home here as it slowly, ominously, blinks.

		IkeSrfLanded = One of the samples has reacted very strangely to the surface of Ike.
		IkeSrfLanded = One of the crystal samples explodes and throws green shards out of the materials bay!

		DresSrfLanded = As the samples process, the computer asks if it can sing you a song while it works. Apparently the song is about a flower of some kind.
		DresSrfLanded = One of the samples evaporates when exposed the environment.

		JoolInSpace = The computer gave an odd report no matter how many times we sent the request. Open the sample bay doors... "I'm sorry, I'm afraid I can't let you do that," was the only reply. The doors did open very promptly, however, when we opened the fusebox panel. Very curious.		
		JoolFlyingHigh = The intense, crushing pressure has drastically changed the composition of the materials. Super heating and ablation effects have been observed. The science bay is looking very disgruntled.
		JoolFlyingLow = The samples burn, boil, or crumple under the extreme pressures and heat. The visual camera shows a wonderful rainbow of colors before it cuts out.
		JoolSrfLanded = You're not sure where the container stops and the samples start anymore...

		LaytheFlyingHigh = One of the samples burns on contact with the atmosphere. Interestingly, the color indicates the presence of oxygen.
		LaytheFlyingLow = The sample smolders and pops as it burns up.
		LaytheSrfLanded = The fine, particulate sand of Laythe blows into the sample bay.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = The sample bay power supply begins to short out! Electricity arcs and etches into the samples of the bay. It's quite the display!

		VallSrfLanded = Many of the samples either freeze or evaporate from the sample container.
		VallSrfLanded = The container sample door freezes up, before finally continuing to open. A thin coating forms on the surface of the samples.

		TyloSrfLanded = One of the samples shatters into a fine mist when exposed to the surface of Tylo.
		
		BopSrfLanded = The samples appear to be having a chemical reaction with the surface of Bop.
		BopSrfLanded = All of the liquid samples instantly evaporate.

		PolSrfLanded = Some of the samples pit and melt when they come in contact with the surface of Pol!

		EelooSrfLanded = Some of the fine crystals lining Eeloo enter the materials bay. It also appears that some of the samples have become more conductive in the extreme cold.

	RESULTS
	{
		default = Cylinders with more than 24 sides appear rounder.
		default = We can now make koffee in zero-gee!
		default = Pasting velcro strips on the walls gives our astronauts places to stick things so they don't float away. Be sure to use the fuzzy side though, the prickly side causes scratches.
		default = Astronauts don't like eating food out of toothpaste tubes.
		default = We've created a new microprobe that can float and take pictures- perfect for selfies.
		default = A happy accident has unlocked a new technology field!

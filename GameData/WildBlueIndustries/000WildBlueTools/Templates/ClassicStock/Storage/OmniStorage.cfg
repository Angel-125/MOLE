//Resource combos make sure that the resources added stay in the correct ratios despite where the sliders are. For instance,
//many rocket engines use a ratio of 0.45/0.55 for LiquidFuel and Oxidizer. No matter where the sliders are, the omni storage
//will ensure that the resource units are automatically adjusted to follow the ratios.
//You can add any number of resources, but make sure that the ratios all add up to 1.0. It also helps if the resource volumes are all the same
//so that the unit volumes are also the same (5-liter units is the stock standard).
//NOTE: For now, only the first combo pattern to match the resources in the omni storage will be applied.

Wild Blue Tools

A KSP mod that provides common functionality for mods by Wild Blue Industries.

---INSTALLATION---

Copy the contents of the mod's GameData directory into your GameData folder.

1.3.8
- Fixed an issue with crew transfers not working after changing a part's crew capacity during a template switch.

1.3.7
- Fixed an issue with WBILight throwing NREs in the VAB/SPH.

1.3.6
- Minor bug fixes

1.3.5
- Fixed an issue where lab experimetns would be completed before even being started.

1.3.4
- Fixed an issue where the "Bonus Science" tab would break the operations manager in the VAB/SPH.

1.3.3 Science Overhaul

- Experiment Manifest and transfer screens now list the part they're associated with.
- Fixed an issue where experiment info wasn't showing up in the VAB/SPH.
- The Load Experiment window now appears slightly offset from the Manifest window to make it easier to distinguish that you're now loading experiments into the part.
- The Transfer Experiment button now makes it more clear that it is a transfer experiment button.
- In the VAB/SPH, the Experiment Manifest will show a new "Load Experiment" button.
- You can now run/pause individual experiments.
- Changed how experiments check for and consume resources; they now go vessel-wide.
- The Experiment Lab will no longer stop if it, say, runs out of resources or the part doesn't have enough crew.
- Improved rendering performance of the experiment windows.
- Fixed an issue where experiments wouldn't show up after reloading a craft.

1.3.2
- New props

1.3.1
- Added Local Operations Manager window to enable controlling all PartModules on all vessels within physics range that implement IOpsView. This is used by mods such as Pathfinder.
- Added Slag and Konkrete resources, templates, and icons.
- Added WBIProspector and WBIAsteroidProcessor. These PartModules can convert non-ElectricCharge resources into all the resources available in a biome/asteroid, and can produce a byproduct resource. A typical use is to convert Ore/Rock into the locally available resources and Slag.
- The Rockhound template now uses the new WBIAsteroidProcessor to convert Ore and/ore Rock.

1.3.0
- Updated to KSP 1.1.3
- Introduced IOpsView to enable command and control of parts from the Operations Manager.
- Refactored the WBIMultiConverter to use a template selector similar to the WBIConvertibleStorage.
- WBIConvertibleStorage/WBIMulticonverter will show you all the templates that a part can use, but templates that you haven't researched yet will be grayed out.

1.2.9
- Removed Dirt from the USI LifeSupport template.
- Added icons for USI-LS templates.
- Added the WBIModuleDecoupler part module that can switch between a decoupler and a separator.

1.2.8
- Fixed an issue where converter text and experiment manifest text wasn't showing up in the VAB/SPH.
- Fixed an issue where you'd see crew portraits in a nearby vessel even though you're focused upon a different vessel.
- Fixed an issue where a science experiment would be run when transferring the experiment out of a lab, even though it hasn't met all the requirements.
- Fixed an issue where a science lab could not transmit data back to KSC when RemoteTech is installed. NOTE: This is a pretty simplistic fix; future updates will account for packet transmission rates etc.

1.2.7
- Fixed issues with USI-LS.

1.2.6
- Added new props

1.2.5
- Improved GUI for selecting resources
- You can now click on the laptop prop's monitor to change the image.

1.2.4
- More Input is NULL error fixes.

1.2.3
- More Input is NULL error fixes.

1.2.2
- Fixed NREs and Input Is NULL errors.

1.2.1
- Minor bug fixes

1.2.0

Science System
- Added a new science system that lets you load experiments into the Coach containers, fly them to your stations and transfer them into a MOLE lab, and once completed, load them back into a Coach for transport back to Kerbin. The experiments have little to no transmit value, encouraging you to bring them home (or if you prefer, load them into an MPL). The new experiments can have many requirements such as orbiting specific planets at specific altitudes, various resources, minimum crew, and required parts. To give players an added challenge, you can optionally specify the percentage chance that an experiment will succeed. You even have the ability to run a specific part module once an experiment has met the prerequisites- that gives you the ability to provide custom benefits. Consult the wiki for more details.

1.1.5
- Adjusted Ore and XenonGas capacities to reflect stock resource volumes.

BARIS: Building A Rocket Isn't Simple

Building rockets can take time!
Staging events can fail!
Parts can wear out!
Event cards!

---INSTALLATION---

Copy the contents of the mod's GameData directory into your KSP's GameData folder. For KSP 1.2.2, you need to also copy the Extras/KSP122DLL/BARIS.dll into GameData/WildBlueIndustries/000BARIS folder.

---REVISION HISTORY---

1.0
- Eliminated duplicate warnings that appear when you revert a non-integrated vessel back to the editor.
- Quality Check event results can be performed as soon as the event card is played instead of waiting for the next quality check.
- Added Micrometeor Damage event card.

0.9
- Added event card images.
- Added KSPedia.
- Added new vehicle integration status screen to the Space Center screen.
- Updated Wiki with new pages and updated existing ones.
- Bug fixes.

0.8
- Fixed an issue where High Bays/Hangar Bays and construction worker GUI would appear even when vehicle integration is turned off and/or when launches can fail.
- Fixed an issue where the BARIS GUI was available when BARIS itself was disabled ("Parts Can Break" option is off).
- Added the Mk1 Launch Escape System. It is designed to fit over the stock Mk16 Parachute but can also be fitted to size 0 parts.

0.7.0
- Added support for KerbalConstructionTime. If installed, then the High Bay/Hangar Bay screen won't be available, and the Space Center screen won't have construction workers.

0.6.0
- Added Event Cards into BARIS. Event Cards will affect your game in various ways; you can enable/disable cards as well as control their frequency of appearing via the Settings->Difficulty dialog. With Debug mode turned on, you can play individual cards as desired from the Space Center BARIS screen.

WANTED: If you're willing to donate screen shots for the cards, I need 256 x 256 images that are appropriate for the event card's subject.

- Fixed an issue with adding/removing workers.
- Added Race Into Space music by Brian Langsbard. License: GPL V2

0.5.3
- Added KSP 1.2.2 version of the BARIS.dll. It is located in the Extras/KSP122DLL folder.

0.5.2
- Fixed another case where you'd get integration warning spam in the editor.
- Fixed an issue where, if you cancel a vehicle integration, the allocated workers were lost.
- Difficulty Modifier is now done by category instead of a raw value.

0.5.1

- Fixed integration warning spam in the editor.
- Fixed duplicate editor bays appearing after upgrading the VAB/SPH.
- Fixed NRE that happens when trying to rebuild the vessel summary cache and there are no vessels in the game.

0.5.0 Pre-release alpha

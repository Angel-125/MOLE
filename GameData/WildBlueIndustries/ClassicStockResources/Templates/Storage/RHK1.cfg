	description = This kit stores "Refined Hydrokerbon #1," which is produced easily compared to producing LiquidFuel from Ore. RHK1 is modestly (around 20%) lighter than LiquidFuel, and burns cleaner than it. It easily may have purposes outside of rocketry.

	description = This kit stores "Refined Hydrokerbon 1" and Oxidizer. With RHK1 being lighter and burning cleaner than LiquidFuel, this mix promises a modest boost in total delta-v with the expense of being hard to come by, once far from a source of Hydrokerbon.

	RESULTS
	{
		default = We've gained some more insight on how the kerbal body is affected by microgravity.
		KerbinInSpace = Results show a loss of muscle mass and strength, especially in the lower extremities.
		KerbinInSpace = Bone density appears to decrease with prolonged exposure to microgravity. Kerbals should exercise regularly to maintain their health.
		KerbinInSpace = Fluids tend to pool in the head and torso.
		KerbinInSpace = Researchers note a performance decrease in the cardiovascular system and a weakened immune system. Recommend regular exercise.
		KerbinInSpace = Kerbals prefer solid foods and ice cream to eating pastes from tubes.

	RESULTS
	{
		default = We've found some tool designs that work in microgravity.
		KerbinInSpace = When turning a screwdriver in one direction, the kerbal will spin in the opposite direction. Future tools should have counter-torque systems built in.
		KerbinInSpace = Kerbals like hammers. They're particularly useful on cantankerous electronics.
		KerbinInSpace = Hand saws are great for zombie apocolypses but aren't so effective in space. Recommend mounting the saw to a bulkhead or other massive object.
		KerbinInSpace = Powered wirecutters should have a hand crank in case extra force is needed.
		KerbinInSpace = Kerbals like kPads. Just sayin.

		KerbinInSpace = With the right seeding, space-grown crystals can really make a difference in radio technology.
		KerbinInSpace = Protein crystals made in space can be quite useful for designing new medicines to combat diseases.
		KerbinInSpace = These crystals can be used for some New Age thingy.
		KerbinInSpace = With enough R&D, an industry could be created around high-quality protein crystal growth.
		KerbinInSpace = This experiment failed to create crystals. Instead we got near-perfect spheres. Maybe a future study could create ballbearings in space.

Mark One Laboratory Extensions (M.O.L.E.)

Are your Mk1 command pods gathering dust? Wish you had a space station earlier in your career? Want to fly more than one kerbal at a time? Then the Mark One Laboratory Extensions (MOLE) are for you! Give your Mk1 command pod a new lease on life by adding a back seat module for an additional kerbal. Then add a docking tunnel system with integrated RCS and parachute for making rendezvous and docking easier. When you're ready for the next step, try out the Mk1.2 "Brumby" 2-seat command pod. Create a simple disposable space station by adding a Mark One Laboratory Extension, power module, and SPF-8 solar panels, and launch it on the 1.875m line of Titan fuel tanks powered by the LV-T270 "Fulcrum" engine. For a longer endurance station, add a Mark One Habitat, or if you're ready to try docking maneuvers, bring up a mini station hub. Your stations can even include the DenEye Space Telescope for, uh, astronomy! Yeah, that's it!

MOLE is a stand-alone parts pack with optional support for Real Chute, KIS/KAS, kOS, CactEye Telescopes Continued, Kerbal Snacks, TAC Life Support, USI-LS, and more.

Real World Inspiration

Back in the 1960s, the USAF had a military space program, and one of its projects was the Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL). MOL was designed as a spy satellite (KH-10 Dorian) disguised as a military research station. One of the cool things about it is that the Gemini spacecraft was already attached to the station when it launched. The Air Force flew a mockup into orbit once, but then the program was cancelled.

---REVISION HISTORY---

0.8.0.2

Station Light
- Reduced research cost and price to be in line with stock lights.
- Moved tech node to Electrics (same as stock lights).

MOH
- Added TAC-LS recyclers to the Dolores Habitat configuration.
- Renamed the Life Support converter (required for the KNUTS experiment when USI-LS is not installed) to KNUTS Processor.

CTT
- Added support for CTT. Tech nodes and parts: If a part isn't listed below, then it stays where it is (unless you have a mod installed that changes the tech node arrangements). MOLE parts should hover around Tier 4/Tier 5 by and large, but if you have suggestions for other CTT nodes for parts I'm happy to listen. :)
Enhanced Survivability: Appaloosa, MK1-85 Heat Shield, Flight Control Package
Simple Command Pods: Brumby

Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue where players could not transfer crew out of a wet workshop that has been converted into a habitable module.
- Fixed an issue where, if you have Pathfinder installed, reconfiguring the MOLE/MOH would not honor Pathfinder's settings for requiring resources and the proper skills to reconfigure the module.

0.8.0.1
- Fixed an issue where the Interstage Adapters required staging to complete.
- Station light won't throw NREs when in the VAB/SPH if turned on.

0.8.0 Outpost

MOLE is getting closer to Core Complete! This release adds new parts including the Mark One Habitat.

New Parts
- Added the WBM-700 fuel tank, a 2.5m fuel tank that has a crew tunnel through its center.
- Added the IA-25, a 2.5m Interstage Adapter. It's just like the IA-18, only bigger. Its central node is setup for 1.25m parts while its outer nodes are ready for 0.625m parts.
- Added the Titan 2.5m Decouplatron, a 2.5m version of the 1.875m Titan Decouplatron. It can be a decoupler or separator.
- Added the SPF-4 Solar Array, a large deployable solar array that's available sooner than the more capable SPF-8. The SPF-4 cannot be retracted, and it cannot track the sun. It is inspired by solar panels found on Skylab. NOTE: For symmetrical part installations, be sure to mirror the panels so they face the desired direction. You can do this by right-clicking the part and pressing "Mirror Panel."
- Added the Mark One Habitat (MOH), a 1.875m habitat that sleeps 2 kerbals. It provides recycling capabilities depending upon the life support mod that you have installed. It has a Dolores Habitat configuration and a Wet Workshop config (that holds LiquidFuel/Oxidizer). With Pathfinder installed, the MOH can also become a Pathfinder Geology Lab, Ponderosa, and Pigpen, albeit with reduced capability due to its smaller size.

Titan II Tanks
- Renamed the Titan II line of tanks to the Konan tanks, in honor of the proposed Titan Barbarian.

Station Experiments
- Added the Kerbal Nutrition Utilization Transfer Study (KNUTS); it requires a Mark One Habitat, Mulch, and LabTime.

0.7.8.1

- Fixed an issue where the Bonus Science tab would break the MOLE Operations Manager in the VAB/SPH.
- Fixed an issue where the light switch wasn't available in the context menu.
- Fixed an issue where the MOLE Lab couldn't generate bonus science when there were no experiments in the lab.

0.7.8

Science System
- Experiment Manifest and transfer screens now list the part they're associated with.
- Fixed an issue where experiment info wasn't showing up in the VAB/SPH.
- The Load Experiment window now appears slightly offset from the Manifest window to make it easier to distinguish that you're now loading experiments into the part.
- The Transfer Experiment button now makes it more clear that it is a transfer experiment button.
- In the VAB/SPH, the Experiment Manifest will show a new "Load Experiment" button.
- You can now run/pause individual experiments.
- Additional MOLE Labs can contribute to a lab currently running experiments as long as the extra labs don't have any experiments running.
- Experiments now individually keep track of the resources they consume during research.
- Added clarification to the MOLE Lab operations manager to make it clear that you will gain bonus science and generate LabTime independently of any running experiments.
- The Experiment Lab will no longer stop if it, say, runs out of resources or the part doesn't have enough crew.
- Improved rendering performance of the experiment windows.
- Previously occupied experiment slots properly report as empty after the completed experiment's final transfer.
- After the final transfer, experiments will show their results (via the stock experiment results window).
- Added the ability to send an in-game email if the MOLE Lab suffers a catastrophic failure during research (assuming you have the "Parts Can Break" option set).
- Added the ability to specify whether or not parts require resources to fix and/or parts can break. Currently this only applies to the MOLE Lab.
- MOLE Lab repairs are working properly.

- Fixed an issue where a science experiment would be run when transferring the experiment out of a lab, even though it hasn't met all the requirements.
- Fixed an issue where the MOLE could not transmit data back to KSC when RemoteTech is installed. NOTE: This is a pretty simplistic fix; future updates will account for packet transmission rates etc.

0.7.3
- Fixed storage and supply issues when USI-LS is installed.
- The Brumby now has an IVA variant for ASET.

0.7.2
- Added Airlock Module to CLS support.
- The Brumby now has an IVA variant for RPM.

0.7.0 Space M+A+X
This update delivers one new part and a bunch of revisions to others. It also delivers a new science system that favors conducting experiments and bringing them home to reap the rewards. More texture revisions are on the way in future updates.
WANTED: Good writers who can help flesh out the descriptions for the experimental results.
WANTED: Playtesters willing to try out the new science experiements and help balance the fun/grind/rewards.

New Part
- Added an airlock module. This module is dedicated to getting your crew into and out of the station.

Interstage Adapters
- Redesigned the IA-18 adapters to let you toggle between 1, 3, 5, and 7 engine nodes in the VAB/SPH. There is enough space for 0.625m engines to sit side by side. When you have CLS installed, the central node is crew accessible.
NOTE: This feature only applies to new craft that you design, not existing craft in the field.

Appaloosa
- Remodeled the part to account for graphics issues uncovered by KSP's new IVA overlay feature. This will only affect new craft; the older model has been deprecated.
- In the VAB/SPH, you can now toggle the top node from its normal recessed position to a position flush with the top of the part.
- After you've unlocked Advanced Flight Control (or are in Sandbox), you can fly a small amount of cargo in the Backseat.
- Reworked the ladder and EVA hatch triggers. Hopefully that'll help with some of the issues people are experiencing.

Brumby
- Retextured to be more porkalike. Thanks for the tips and feedback, CobaltWolf! :)
- Fixed top node to the correct location.
- Reworked the ladder and EVA hatch triggers. Hopefully that'll help with some of the issues people are experiencing.

Station Hub
- Removed side EVA hatch; you can still transfer crew into and out of the module via the context menu.
- Added end-cap EVA hatches as emergency exits- great for those kerbal rescue missions.
- Added TAC-LS configurations for those who run with TAC-LS. There is a carbon extractor, water purifier, and water splitter. Being early tech, they're not as good as the 1.25m TAC converters, and they pretty much take up the whole module. Thanks for the suggestion, TheReadPanda! :)
NOTE: if you have an existing station hub in orbit, it will retain its side EVA hatch; the changes only apply to new craft.

MOLE
- MOLE IVA is now complete.
- Retextured exterior to be more porkalike.
- Removed side EVA hatch; you can still transfer crew into and out of the module via the context menu.
- Added end-cap EVA hatches as emergency exits- great for those kerbal rescue missions.
- MOLE lab now generates LabTime.
- Reduced the amount of science generated by the MOLE Lab to 0.1 per day.
- Fixed an issue where the MOLE would receive science reports even when it wasn't configured as a Mobile Processing Lab. Thanks for the detailed bug report, MaxRebo! :)
NOTE: if you have an existing MOLE in orbit, it will retain its side EVA hatch; the changes only apply to new craft.

Science System
- Added a new science system that lets you load experiments into the Coach containers, fly them to your stations and transfer them into a MOLE lab, and once completed, load them back into a Coach for transport back to Kerbin. The experiments have little to no transmit value, encouraging you to bring them home (or if you prefer, load them into an MPL). The new experiments can have many requirements such as orbiting specific planets at specific altitudes, various resources, minimum crew, and required parts. To give players an added challenge, you can optionally specify the percentage chance that an experiment will succeed. You even have the ability to run a specific part module once an experiment has met the prerequisites- that gives you the ability to provide custom benefits. Just be sure to implement the IWBIExperimentResults interface.

Coach
- Added new Science! template. Use this template to add up to 4 science experiments to study at your space stations. The Coach 300 holds 6.
- Changed default template from Storage to Science!
- Added TAC-LS storage templates (requires TAC-LS).

Station Experiments
- Added Space Adaption Study. Requires LabTime, kerbals, and a station orbiting Kerbin.
- Added Orbital Construction Techniques. Requires LabTime and a station orbiting Kerbin.
- Added Crystal Growth Experiment. Requires LabTime and a station orbiting Kerbin.
- Added Power Tools Evaluation. Requires LabTime and a station orbiting Kerbin.

Other
- Added the K-15 to the SampleCraft folder. This sub-orbital demonstrator can reach orbit if flown right.
- The O-2 engines now have action options to arm and disarm the abort mode.

0.6.1

FCP & Mk1 Docking Port
- Fixed RealChute drag problems. Thanks for the fix, dave1904! :)

Station Light
- Remodeled the light slightly to make it look better.

Mk1 Drydock
- Fixed a texturing issue with the Mk1 Drydock.

Life Support
- Added support for Kerbalism
- Added support for USI-LS. Thanks for the number crunching, Bombaatu! :)

0.6.0 Earth Orbit Stations

With KSP 1.1.X shenanigans finally out of the way, I'm back to creating updates for the MOLE. This update continues with Phase 2: Project Space Station, and delivers new station parts.

-Updated to KSP 1.1.2

New Parts
- Added the Mk1 Drydock. You can use this to build new vessels if you have Extraplanetary Launchpads (EL) installed. The part won't be available if you have Pathfinder installed.
- The MOLE and Station Hub now have EL productivity values.
- Added a 1.875m docking port. This docking port is designed to dock station modules together and provides a wider hard dock than the Mk1 ports.
- Added the Titan Separator Unit. This is a separator built to provide a clean separation between two parts.
- Added a station light. You can configure the color and intensity in the VAB/SPH and in flight.

0.5.0.11
- Updated to KSP 1.1.1
- Fixed an issue where the MOLE's lights would not turn on.
- The MOLE IVA won't be shown when the module is configured to hold LFO and has no crew capacity.

0.5.0.10
- Fixed issue with Appaloosa when using Sandbox mode.

0.5.0.9
- Removed redundant LFO template

0.5.0.8
- Recompiled for KSP 1.1 release
- Updated to latest WildBlueTools

0.5.0.7
- Recompiled for latest KSP 1.1
- Storage containers now use new part module; you might need to hyperedit resources back in.

0.5.0.6
- Recompiled for the release version of KSP 1.1
- Changed the resource required to reconfigure modules from RocketParts to Equipment.
- Added Equipment storage template.

0.5.0.5 (KSP 1.1 pre-release)
- Added MOLE Settings window to the application toolbar. If you disable "Require resources to reconfigure modules" then you no longer need to bring resources to convert convert a wet workshop into a usable module or to change a module's configuration. Similarly, if you disable "Require skill check to reconfigure modules" then you no longer need to have a skilled engineer/scientist to reconfigure the module.
NOTE: If you have Pathfinder installed, then the MOLE Settings window will not appear. Use the Pathfinder Settings window instead.

0.5.0.4 (KSP 1.1 pre-release)
- Updated Station Hub IVA to reflect new KSP 1.1 cutaway view mode.

0.5.0.3 (KSP 1.1 pre-release)
- Wild Blue Tools updated
- RCS makes sounds now.

0.5.0.2 (KSP 1.1 pre-release)
- Removed Bigby Crew Module- it's just a concept design right now and not ready for use.
- When converted to a fuel tank, the MOLE will hide its window, EVA hatch, and ladder rungs. They'll show up again when you convert the MOLE back into a lab.

0.5.0.1
- Updated for KSP 1.1.
NOTE: This is a PRE-RELEASE version! Not guaranteed to work as KSP 1.1 Pre-Release is itself unstable. This has been tested against my own mods but NOT with other mods. I cannot realistically provide support for MOLE working with other mods until KSP 1.1 is officially released, and the other mod(s) have been updated to the release-version of KSP 1.1. All that said, I've done the best I can to test MOLE, and I do appreciate the testing you might do during the pre-release. :)
- Updated to latest Community Resource Pack and Module Manager (Both Pre-release KSP 1.1)

MOLE
- Added the pre-release IVA. The release version will (hopefully) be done when KSP 1.1 is finalized.
- You can now reconfigure the MOLE after launch.
- Added a LFO template. Now you can launch the MOLE full of fuel, and then outfit it as a lab after reaching orbit. This is similar to the proposed "Wet Workshop" approach to Skylab. As a fuel tank, the MOLE holds about 80% of the fuel as a Titan 900 due to the extra parts it has to store to make it convertible.

Titan Tanks (& Coach)
- Adjusted where the tanks show up in the tech tree: 
  Coach 225: General Rocketry
  Titan-450: Advanced Rockety
  Titan-900: Advanced Rocketry
  Titan-1800: Fuel Ststems

Brumby
- Updated the TAC-LS resource amounts. Thanks StevieC! :)
- Minor updates to the IVA to reflect the new internal overlay.

0.5 Project Space Station

This update introduces the Station Logistics Hub, the Structural Adapter, and the Gemini-like Brumby. Also, the Mk1 Radial port, SPF-8, and Titan Instrument Unit have been slightly revised.

New Parts
- Added the Mk1-88 "Brumby," a 2-kerb, 1.875m, Gemini-like capsule. It is available at Advanced Flight Control. The stock IVA is complete; RPM and ASET IVAs will arrive in a future update.
- Added Station Logistics Hub. This hub has five connector ports. The 3 side ports are designed for the Mk1 docking ports but can accommodate Clamp-O-Tron ports. The hub functions as a minimalist probe core and can hold a small amount of resource storage. Inspiration comes from the ISS's Harmony module.
- Added the Structural Adapter, a 1.875m to 1.25m adapter similar to the Rockomax Adapter. Thanks for the suggestion, RocketSquid! :)

FCP
- Fixed an issue that prevented the FCP from working properly in Career/Science Sandbox mode when Advanced Flight Control hasn't been unlocked.

Titan Tanks
- Fixed issues where the tanks would "hover" when radially attached to other parts.

Titan II Tanks
- Due to confusion in the parts catalog, moved the Titan II line of tanks out of the MOLE category. You can still find them in the stock Fuel Tanks tab.

Coach (225 & 300)
- Added CLS support.

SD-18 & SD-25
- Added Enable/Disable Decoupler button that is only available in the VAB/SPH. If you disable the decoupler, you won't be able to fire the decoupler in flight. This can be a Good Thing (TM) if you just want to use the parts as an adapter.

0.4.3 The difficult we do today, the impossible is in R&D

This update delivers some part revisions, a new radial docking port, and some bug fixes.

New Part
- Added the Mk1 Radial Docking Port. It is compatible with the Mk1 Docking Port, Clamp-O-Tron Jr. and can be radially attached. It doesn't have a drogue chute.

MOLE
- Once you've unlocked Advanced Exploration, The MOLE can serve as a Mobile Processing Laboratory (at reduced capacity) or as the basic research lab. You'll have to configure the MOLE in the VAB/SPH before launch, and you can't reconfigure it after launch. If you have Pathfinder installed, then as before, you can configure the lab as a basic research lab or as any of the standard Pathfinder science labs.
NOTE: Code changes make it necessary for you to retire your existing MOLE modules.

Backseat
- Moved to Flight Control.

Interstage Service Compartment
- Retextured the sides to help emphasize the built-in radiator.
- Added cosmetic avionics boxes.
- Added aft-facing RCS ports.

1.875m Heat Shield
- Moved to Flight Control.

FCP & Mk1 Docking Port
- Resized to Size 0 (0.625m diameter). You'll need to use the VAB/SPH offset tool to flush-mount them to the Mk1 command pod's nose.
- Added forward-facing RCS ports to the FCP.

Bug Fixes
- Removed "Toggle Decals" buttons from the Coaches. Thanks for the feedback, tater! :)
- The Interstage Service Compartment is now easier to attach to your vessels. Thanks again, tater! :)
- Fixed an issue with the MOLE where it wasn't providing the ability to review your research.
- Fixed an issue with the Cryo Engines template that was adding liquid hydrogen to everything. Thanks kerbas_ad_astra! :)

0.4.2 For Science!

Looks like I got ahead of myself with the version numbering and features. This release straightens it all out. I'm also happy to report that with this update, MOLE Phase 1 is complete! I'm now working on MOLE Phase 2, which adds the 1.875m station components, and is about halfway done.

New Parts
- Added the MOLE, a 1.875m science lab. It can perform basic science by consuming ResearchKits. A 2.5m version is planned. The IVA is on backorder- artist's block.
  * If you have Pathfinder installed, then you can configure it for Science operations at reduced efficiency compared to the Doc Science Lab. 
  * NOTE: Unlike the Doc, you CANNOT reconfigure the MOLE during flight.
- Added the Titan Nose Cone, a 1.875m nose cone based on the stock Mk7 nose cone, but with new textures.
- Added the Titan Adapter Tank, a 1.875m to 2.5m fuel tank.
- Added the Power Module, a 1.875m station module with a Monopropellant Power Unit (MPU), MonoPropellant, and ElectricCharge.
- Added the SPF-8 solar panel; this large, early model solar panel is roughly equal to 8 OX-4 solar panels and costs about as much.
- Added the O-2 "Oxygen" monopropellant powered thruster. It is an OMS engine that can function as a launch abort motor in an emergency.

Mk-85 Backseat
- Adjusted the center of bouyancy. Thanks for the tips, Kerbas_ad_astra! :)
- Finished up the IVA flight controls.

Mk1 Docking Port
- Added RealChute support.
- For RealChute, the cut altitude of the drogue chute equals the deployment altitude of the main chute.
NOTE: With RealChute installed, you won't see the staging icon for the docking port until you right-click the part and select Enable Staging. This is a KSP/RealChute issue that arises from the combined docking port and parachute.
- If you DON'T have RealChute installed, the Mk1 Docking Port can now auto-cut the drogue chute. By default, the cut altitude (700 meters) equals the deploy altitude of the FCP.

Titan Instrument Unit
- Revised the part description and made the crew tube height flush with the structural ring.

Sample Craft
- Added the Titan ATV. It is configured to carry LiquidFuel, Oxidizer, MonoPropellant, and has two Coaches ready to accept parts stored via KIS.
- Added the Titan MOLE. This craft is a single-use space station consisting of the Appaloosa and the new Mark One Laboratory Extension (MOLE), along with the new solar panels and station power module.
- Made some minor updates to the K-20 Kestrel.

Bug Fixes
- Fixed issues with the FCP not working with RealChute.
- Fixed (again) the FCP's misreported height issue in VAB/SPH engineering report.
- Adjusted the place where rocket exhaust comes out of the LV-T270 Fulcrum.
- The Backseat MPU should properly consume MonoPropellant while generating ElectricCharge now.

0.4.1 
- Updated to latest WildBlueTools

0.3 Remember the Titans!

This update introduces a bunch of new parts. Chief among them is the Titan series of fuel tanks and associated hardware. The textures are based upon the Titan II Gemini Launch Vehicle. This release also redesigns the Flight Control Package slightly to be virtually the same diameter as the Mk1 command pod's upper attachment node. You also get a complementary docking port since the Clamp-O-Tron Jr no longer fits on the FCP. Finally, the Backseat received some minor tweaks.

New Parts
- Added the Titan series of fuel tanks. They are 1.875m in diameter and come in three sizes: the 450, 900, and 1800. These tanks are fully compatible with the Wild Blue Industries' resource template system, and can hold parts if converted to storage and KIS is installed.
- Added the Titan II series of fuel tanks. They are 2.5m in diameter and come in four sizes. They're equal to the Rockomax 8, 16, 32, and 64 but are also fully compatible with the WBI resource template system. The Titan II series is a KSP version of the real-world Titan "Barbarian" variant.
- Added the Coach 225, a 1.875m logistics module.
- Added the Coach 300, a 2.5m logistics module.
- Added the 1.875m Payload Faring. This is just a modified stock faring that's been resized for 1.875m diameter.
- Added the Titan Instrument Unit. This is a 1.875m probe core/gyro assembly combo. It can be upgraded as technology improves, and includes a kOS CPU if the kOS mod is installed.
- Added the Twin Engine Coupler. This 1.875m engine mount has space for a pair of 1.25m engines and carries a small amount of fuel.
- Added the Quad Engine Coupler. This is a 2.5m engine with space for four 1.25m engines, and it too carries a small amount of fuel.
- Added the Short Interstage Adapter. This 1.875m adapter lets you attach 1.25m diameter engines.
- Added the Long Interstage Adapter. This 1.875m adapter lets you attach 1.25m diameter engines.
- Added the Mk1 Docking Port, specially designed for the Mk1 command pod and the Flight Control Package. It is fully compatible with the Clamp-O-Tron Jr, and it contains a small drogue chute. It cannot be radially attached, however.
- Added the LV-T270 "Fulcrum" rocket engine. It is designed after the stock LV-T series of rocket engines.

FCP
- Redesigned the Flight Control Package to be virtually the same diameter as the Mk1 command pod's upper attachment node. I like the slimmer look. :)
- Fixed an issue that allowed RCS thrusters to work when you haven't unlocked the proper tech node.

Backseat
- Added support for kOS if the mod is installed.
- Removed RocketParts resource; the Coach can bring them up if needed.
- Fixed the Supplies resource for when USI-LS is installed.

Sample Craft
- Added several sample craft. You can find them in the MOLE/SampleCraft/VAB folder.

0.2 Further Developments
This update brings some tweaks, a new internal view, and a complete redesign of the Interstage Service Compartment.

MK85 Heat Shield
- Tweaked the heat shield mass and Ablator to be inline with stock heat shields.

FCP
- Adjusted drag curve for the FCP. Combined with the heat shield change, this should help with self-aligning the capsule for re-entry.

SD-18 & SD-25
- Made some minor mesh improvements to the SD-18 and SD-25 adapters to make them look nicer. I think I'm finally satisfied with their look. :) NOTE: As a reminder, you can toggle the staging icon off and use the adapter/decoupler as an adapter only. And you can flip them around to adapt to different sizes.

Backseat
- Added IVA for the Backseat. It has support for stock props and ASET props. Control layout is a work in progress, but it totally beats the placeholder IVA. Cockpit lights are named CockpitLight, just in case somebody adds an ASET cockpit light switch. ;)
- Added USI-LS support to the Backseat for when USI Life Support is installed. It has 15 days of supplies for two kerbals (you get a total of 30 days with the Mk1 pod and the Backseat due to how USI-LS works).
- The SAS level will be automatically upgraded as technology improves: Advanced Flight Control, level 2; Specialized Control, level 3. Sandbox mode gives level 3.
- Added camera transforms: cameraTransformFront, cameraTransformLeft, cameraTransformRight, cameraTransformBottom. These are for Raster Prop Monitor cameras.

Appaloosa Interstage Service Compartment (ISC)
- Added side doors that you can open to access equipment inside of the compartment for when the aft end is blocked by another stage component.
- Added RCS thruster ports (as long as you've unlocked Advanced Flight Control).
- Added a decoupler; arrows show which way it decouples.
- Added an active radiator that can be switched on and off.
- Added a crew tube that can be toggled (it's largely cosmetic).

Other
- Added bulkhead profiles courtesy of kerbas-ad-astra. Thanks! :)
- Added support for Connected Living Spaces to the Backseat, FCP, WBM-400, Mk85 Heat Shield, SD-18, ISC, and SD-25, courtesy of kerbas-ad-astra. Thanks! :)

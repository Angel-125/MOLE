	RESULTS
	{
		default = Anyone got a mousetrap?  Oh, um: Experiment succeeded.

		KerbinInSpace = Glykerol test succeeded: Mouse survived the thaw process, and appears to be unharmed in all respects.  Wait, you want to try this on who now?  Um, yeah, the mouse appears to be coughing a bit...
		KerbinInSpace = Glycerol test failed: The mouse appears to be dead.  No visible damage to that we can see.  Now what?
		KerbinInSpace = Glycerol test failed: Jeb drank the glycerol.  On a sidenote: Getting Jeb on a sugar high in an enclosed space is not recommended.
		KerbinInSpace = Ethylene glycol test failed: The mouse appeared to revive a moment before dying.  Symptoms indicate acute oxalic acid poisoning.
		KerbinInSpace = Propylene glycol test a partial success: The mouse was successfully revived, but appears to have suffered severe damage to it's musculature and cognitive functions.  Bill is having fun racing it through the maze.

	RESULTS
	{
		default = Ok, we've thawed the mouse and it's running around.  And um, chewing the wires in the radio.  Hello?  Anyone hear me?

        KerbinInSpace = The process appears to not cause any significant harm to the subject.  Um, yes, I think we can find volunteers to try it - Bill, come over here...
        KerbinInSpace = Cognitive function appears unimpaired.  The mouse beats Bill through the maze by a factor of 50%.
        KerbinInSpace = There was an issue with the glykerol feed during revival.  The mouse appears ok, despite that.
        KerbinInSpace = There was an unplanned thaw event.  Apparently you can't just unplug this thing.  Anyone have an idea how to get the smell of dead mouse out of a spaceship?
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = The more intense radiation of deeper space doesn't appear to affect the DeepFreeze process.
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = The combination of the ion storm and the restricted glykerol feed has had an unanticipated affect on the mouse: It's skin has taken on an unhealthy pinkish tone, along with extreme growth in most of the body, with the exception of the cranial cavity, which has shrunk.  General health appears fine despite that, but further testing is warranted.
        MunSrfLanded = The Mun's low gravity field makes testing the mouse's abilities easier.  No affect on the DeepFreeze process however.
        MunSrfLanded = We've successfully brought a mouse back to life on the Mun.  We're not gods now?
        MinmusSrfLanded = Testing on Minmus appears to be redundant.  The process is proven to work on mice.
        MinmusSrfLanded = Attempting to use the surface of Minmus as a freezer has fatally injured the mouse.  In the future, we'll need to remember to keep the subject inside the cryogenic chamber.

	RESULTS
	{
		default = We've successfully frozen and revived a Kerbal.  *Faints*

		KerbinInSpace = Is this really the way we want to travel the stars?
		KerbinInSpace = Bill was revived successfully.  Just in time too: The O2 unit needs replacing, and he's the only one who knows how to do it.  Hmm, what's that mouse doing in the air system?
		KerbinInSpace = Jeb finds being frozen very relaxing, and appears unharmed.
        KerbinInSpace = We will have to institute procedures to make sure the frozen Kerbals are left undisturbed and their stuff is left alone.  Valentina woke to a very disturbing sight of our newest scientist.  Um, you may have to send a rescue mission to retrieve a stranded Kerbal soon...

	    KerbinInSpace = There is a sense of dissociation upon waking from a long-term freezing: You know time has passed, but it doesn't feel like it.
	    KerbinInSpace = Bone density is nominal.  Muscle loss is minimal.  All biological systems are apparently normal.  Cognitive function is unimpaired.  This really works.  We can send Kerbals on years-long trips without them using supplies or getting bored.  Yes Jeb, you can go now.

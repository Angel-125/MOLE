    	description = The DStaal Institute of Technology (DIT) came up with this study to learn how temperatures change in space. Does being in the sun help? We're not sure yet - go find out.

	requiredParts = 2HOT Thermometer
	situations = ORBITING;LANDED

	RESULTS
	{
		default = Sometimes the temperature goes up, and sometimes it goes down.  We're not sure why, although the sight of Kerbol seems to have something to do with it.

		KerbinSrfLanded = Daytime temperatures are somewhat higher than nighttime temperatures here.
		KerbinSrfLandedTundra = Temperatures go down if you put the thermometer underground.  Of course, the thermometer is designed to be operated in space...
		KerbinSrfSplashed = The presence of water seems to mitigate the day/night temperature shifts.
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = We expected the temperature to be remain very high, but it seems the desert cools off quite a bit at night.

		KerbinInSpace = Measuring the temperature of space appears to be very hard - we are getting the temperature of our ship, not the surrounding vacuum.
		KerbinInSpace = Temperature readings appear to be largely dependent on whether the thermometer is exposed to Kerbol at the time of the reading.
		KerbinInSpace = Experimental readings were disrupted by Bill trying to bake a cake.  Where he found an oven we're not sure.  The cake was delicious though.
		KerbinInSpace = Temperatures inside the ship are largely as set by the life support system.  Wait, you wanted us to measure the *outside* temperature changes?

    	description = Living in space requires keeping things hot or cold - study how different materials transmit heat in space. Sponsored by the DStaal Institute of Technology (DIT).

	requiredParts = 2HOT Thermometer
	situations = ORBITING;LANDED

	RESULTS
	{
		default = The ship's insulation operates within expected parameters.

		KerbinSrfLanded = The A/C works fine.
		KerbinSrfSplashed = Water tends to remove heat from the ship faster than air does.

		KerbinInSpace = Without air outside, it's harder than expected to keep the ship cool.  I thought space was cold?
		KerbinInSpace = With all heaters shut down, the ship was able to cool slowly until Jeb decided he was cold and turned them back on.
		KerbinInSpace = Equilibrium temperature of the test module was colder than Kerbals would like to be.

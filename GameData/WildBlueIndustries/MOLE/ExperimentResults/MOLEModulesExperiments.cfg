	RESULTS
	{
		default = It appears that the crew has a green thumb. Which should be obvious.
		KerbinInSpace = Plant roots don't know which way is down in microgravity.
		KerbinInSpace = The plants appear malnurished. Perhaps a richer soil content will help then grow better in the future.
		KerbinInSpace = Seaweed really likes water, not fertilizer.
		MunInSpace = The plants seem to have absorbed more radiation than expected.
		MinmusInSpace = Clovers grow really well in space, though radiation has a few created five-leaf clovers.
		DunaInSpace = Research has concluded that roses can become many colores besides red.
		JoolInSpace = Spinnach, it's what's for dinner. Maybe some iceberg lettice too.
		JoolInSpace = Plants don't like the radiation. Better hardening will help.
		PolInSpace = After a major sneezing fit, the crew has decided not to grow dandelions in the future.

	title = Solar Activity Monitoring Experiment
	baseValue = 25

	description = The Solar Activity Monitoring Experiment (SAME) endeavors to watch the sun and study its activity. By studying its properties, we might some day predict when its solar storms occur, and perhaps find a way to harness its energy for space travel beyond mere solar panels.

	RESULTS
	{
		default = My Squad, it's full of a star!
		KerbinInSpace = The sun's surface looks random and chaotic. It would make a good kerbal.
		KerbinInSpace = Great plumes of flame belch from the sun every now and them. The arcs are long enough to easily span the diameter of Kerbin.
		KerbinInSpace = The explosive gasses emitted by the sun contain heavy ions that might interact with Kerbin's radiation belts- and cause electromagnetic storms that can affect electronics.
		KerbinInSpace = Someday, it might be advantageous to watch the sun for coronal mass ejection events. If we can predict when these occur, crews on deep space missions can take cover.
		KerbolInSpaceHigh = In addition to explosive outbursts, the sun appears to emit a continuous stream of particles, a solar wind as it were. Maybe someday the solar wind can be harnessed by a star sailing craft.
		KerbolInSpaceLow = The radiation is very intense here.

	RESULTS

		KerbinInSpace = The telescope has incredibly good vision. From a low orbit it could probably read the license plates on vehicles.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Yup, definitely can read the license plates on vehicles from this altitude.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = Not much to see from this altitude except a pretty blue planet.
		KerbinInSpaceLowWater = We're able to track the movements of vessels on the ocean by looking for their wake.
		KerbinInSpaceLowGrasslands = There are a number of farms that can be spotted from this altitude. Someone even wrote "KSP Level 1" on their barn roof.
		KerbinInSpaceLowMountains = We can see clear to the mountains from here!
		KerbinInSpaceLowDeserts = Some of these deserts are pretty flat and could be used as alternate landing sites for shuttle craft.
		KerbinInSpaceLowIceCaps = We keep looking for signs of crashed flying saucers, but all we see is ice.
		KerbinInSpaceLowKSC = It would appear that there is a great deal of activity at the launch center. It appears that they're getting ready to launch! Oh wait. That's the KSC. Nothing to see here.
		KerbinInSpaceLowHighlands = We're not sure who wants to live forever, but we're likely to spot them from orbit.
		KerbinInSpaceLowBadlands = The Badlands don't look at that bad from low orbit. Maybe they should be renamed the Not So Badlands.
		KerbinInSpaceLowShores = Looks like somebody is having a beach party down there, but we're guessing that's not information that <CLASSIFIED> is looking for.

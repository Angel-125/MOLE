	RESULTS
	{
		default = We've gained some more insight on how the kerbal body is affected by microgravity.
		KerbinInSpace = Results show a loss of muscle mass and strength, especially in the lower extremities.
		KerbinInSpace = Bone density appears to decrease with prolonged exposure to microgravity. Kerbals should exercise regularly to maintain their health.
		KerbinInSpace = Fluids tend to pool in the head and torso.
		KerbinInSpace = Researchers note a performance decrease in the cardiovascular system and a weakened immune system. Recommend regular exercise.
		KerbinInSpace = Kerbals prefer solid foods and ice cream to eating pastes from tubes.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = Increased levels of cellular damage is noted further from Kerbin's magnetosphere.  Increasing radiation shielding is recommended.  As a side note, Bill now glows slightly.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = High orbit does not appear to significantly change effects to bone and muscle density vs. low orbit.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = Kerbals like looking at the stars.  Could we get a window?

		MunSrfLanded = Muscle mass and strength loss is mitigated by the 0.166g gravitational field on Mun's surface.  But only slightly.
		MunSrfLanded = Researchers note an unexpected increase in performance of the cardiovascular system from living on the Mun.  As a side note, jumping in low gravity is fun.
		MunSrfLanded = A strange burning smell has been traced to the dust tracked in by returning EVAs.  Bob has advised everyone to not panic - it appears to be the scent of Mun dust, and does not mean there's an actual fire.

		MunInSpace = The plants seem to have absorbed more radiation than expected.

	RESULTS

		default = We've found some tool designs that work in microgravity.
		KerbinInSpace = When turning a screwdriver in one direction, the kerbal will spin in the opposite direction. Future tools should have counter-torque systems built in.
		KerbinInSpace = Kerbals like hammers. They're particularly useful on cantankerous electronics.
		KerbinInSpace = Hand saws are great for zombie apocolypses but aren't so effective in space. Recommend mounting the saw to a bulkhead or other massive object.
		KerbinInSpace = Powered wirecutters should have a hand crank in case extra force is needed.
		KerbinInSpace = Kerbals like kPads. Just sayin.
		MunInSpace = Tool design does not appear to be affected by what body we orbit.  The engineers refer you to the results from Kerbin orbit.
		MinmusInSpace = In a completely unexpected finding, orbiting Minmus appears to be the same as orbiting Kerbin for designing hammers.  There have been some interesting ideas for ice cream scoops though.
		MunSrfLanded = Screwdriver designs for the Mun appear to be much easier than for microgravity.  It has to do with Bill being able to put his feet on the ground.
		MunSrfLanded = Mundust appears to be electrically charged and very fine.  Ideal for making power tools malfunction.
		// Note that the 'Y/S' is intentional, not a typo.  It's malfunctioning.

		KerbinInSpace = Protein crystals made in space can be quite useful for designing new medicines to combat diseases.
		KerbinInSpace = These crystals can be used for some New Age thingy.
		KerbinInSpace = With enough R&D, an industry could be created around high-quality protein crystal growth.
		KerbinInSpace = This experiment failed to create crystals. Instead we got near-perfect spheres. Maybe a future study could create ballbearings in space.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = Crystals in space tend to be thinner and spikier than those grown closer to the planetary surface.
		MunSrfLanded = Crystals grown on beds of Munar regolith exhibit some fascinatingly unusual grow patterns.  Further research will be needed to see if they are useful for anything.
		MunSrfLanded = Mun's low gravity means that crystals grown on it's surface are very similar to crystals grown in space.  It might be worth setting up a production facility.

		MunSrfLanded = The upper layers of the Mun's surface - while geologically stable - appear to shift randomly with the day/night cycle.  Care should be taken when placing structures on the surface to place them on as level a field as possible.
		MunSrfLanded = Building a base on the Mun is definitely possible.
		KerbinSrfLanded = We have successfully learned how to build on Kerbin.
		KerbinSrfLanded = You know, we didn't really need an air-tight rocket capable of going into space to do this.
		KerbinSrfLanded = Kerbin's surface actually makes a pretty poor building material.  To much organic matter.
		KerbinSrfLandedTundra = Cutting up the ground appears to make a good building material.  Until it heats up.
		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = Igloos are the future.

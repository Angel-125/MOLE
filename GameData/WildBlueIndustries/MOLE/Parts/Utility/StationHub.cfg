	description = Built from several Coaches stacked together, this module is a logistics hub that can serve as a cornerstone for a space station. The hub has a small amount of storage capacity as well as probe core components "borrowed" from a Stayputnik. As long as nobody notices the missing components, everything will be fine. You'll find a little extra something in your sales brochure, you didn't see nothing.

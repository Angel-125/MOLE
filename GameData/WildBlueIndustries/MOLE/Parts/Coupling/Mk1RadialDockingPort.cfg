PART
{
// this is a sample config file, for determining a good file format for defining part parameters
// comment line - ignored by cfg parser
// empty lines, or lines without a '=' sign are also ignored
// all other lines are split at the '=' sign, and the left operand is used to know what parameter we are setting
// diferent parameters require data in different formats (see docs), and each module has it's own parameters (again, see docs)
// each assignment must be in a single line. Lines without assignments will be ignored. (You CAN turn on word wrap, though)
// each keyword here relates to an existing variable in the assigned module. If the keyword isn't found, it is ignored.
// conversely, if a keyword is left unassigned (as in not in the file), it will be initialized with it's default value
// This is done automatically, so any public variable defined in the loaded module can be accessed this way (provided it's value can be parsed)

	description = Unlike its stack-mounted counterpart, the Mk1 Radial Docking Port can be attached radially. It lacks a drogue chute, however. It is fully compatible with the Clamp-O-Tron Jr. port, and two Mk1 ports can be welded together. Unlike Junior, an access hatch allows transfer between vessels. Contrary to popular belief, kerbals actually can fit through the hatch as long as they leave their helmets behind.

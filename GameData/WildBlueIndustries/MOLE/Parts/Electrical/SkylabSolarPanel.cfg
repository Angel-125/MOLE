	title = SPF-6 Solar Array
	manufacturer = Wild Blue Industries
	description = The SPF-6 is an early attempt at creating deployable solar array. The technology is pretty new, so the solar array cannot be retracted, and the engineers don't know how to point the array at the sun. And watch out for micrometeor shields, they tend to destroy the solar array. NOTE: BE SURE TO CHECK THE SOLAR PANEL'S ORIENTATION BEFORE LAUNCH! You can right-click the part and press "Mirror Panel" to mirror the solar panel.

	description = During a visit to Probodobodyne, Wild Blue's engineers discovered that their OX-4 series of solar panels are quite fragile. Their "you break it you buy it" policy left Wild Blue with numerous broken solar panels that would've left the company in financial ruin had a clever engineer not come up with a plan to piece the panels back together. The end result was the SPF-8, a large solar panel that can track the sun but can only be deployed once. The design was so successful, Wild Blue's engineers now look forward to the annual company trip to Probodobodyne.

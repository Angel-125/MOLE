	description = Based on their successful FLM series of multipurpose storage tanks, the new Titan line not only stores a wide variety of resources, it can also be used to store equipment and parts. The Titan-900 is the mid-sized tank. It's guaranteed to leak less that previous models, and it's actually cost-effective.

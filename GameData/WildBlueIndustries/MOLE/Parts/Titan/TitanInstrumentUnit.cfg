	description = Wild Blue Industries wanted an outdoor swimming pool and their subcontractor built them a warehouse full of fuel tanks instead. The company repurposed them into a guidance package by using the guts of Stayputnik probe core and tacking on gyros from the Mk-85 command pod. The end result was a simple but effective probe core that could also be used to provide flight stabilization. And that's when they realized that they also needed fuel tanks sized for the insturment unit. The Titan Instrument Unit's capabilities improve as technology does, but it isn't very good a predicting when the AE-35 Unit will experience a failure.

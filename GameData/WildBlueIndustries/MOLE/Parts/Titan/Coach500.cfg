	description = When you want to haul a small amount of stuff, it's time to travel in Coach. This shipping container offers no-frills storage. Who needs things like "structural bracing," "legroom," and "cargo nets" when you can get a container so cheaply! The Coach cannot be flown on blackout days. Sales are non-refundable. Storage items cost extra. Void where prohibited. Warranty void if removed from the VAB or SPH. Not responsible for damaged or lost goods.

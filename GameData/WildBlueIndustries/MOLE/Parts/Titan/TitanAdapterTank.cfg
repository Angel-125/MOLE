	description = Wild Blue came up with their brand new Titan and Titan II fuel tank lines, but nobody thought to create a fuel tank that could bridge the two diameters- until now. Introducing the Titan Tank Adapter, designed to hold a small amount of rocket fuel while bridging the divide between the 1.875m Titan tanks and the 2.5m Titan II tanks. That's what the marketing brochure says, the engineers actually goofed and tried to weld two end caps of different sizes together.

	description = The same bean counter at Wild Blue Industries who thought up the Interstage Adapter came up with this twin engine coupler. Just clip one to the aft end of a Titan tank and then bolt a couple of engines onto it. Due to budget cuts, it lacks the ability to stack components below it, but it has a small amount of fuel as compensation.

	description = Based on their successful FLM series of multipurpose storage tanks, the new Titan line not only stores a wide variety of resources, it can also be used to store equipment and parts. The Titan-450 is the smallest in the series, offering 40% more storage space when compared to the Buckboard MC-1000. Wild Blue's atorneys insist that any similarity to WadeCo swimming pools is purely coincidental and they will flatly deny any allegations that customers have found WadeCo labels on the inside of the tanks.

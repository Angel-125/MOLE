	manufacturer = Wild Blue Industries
	description = Wild Blue Industries tried to make an RCS thruster for the space program but lost the competition when their prototype thruster's fuel valves kept getting stuck open and burned uncontrollably. Marketing execs saw the design flaw as an opportunity to produce an engine could serve as a launch abort motor in an emergency. The engineers are sure that the O-2's stuck valve problem is fixed, making it also useful as a small orbital engine that burns monopropellant. Well, they're mostly sure.

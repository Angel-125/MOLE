	RESULTS
	{
		default = The crew was too busy munching on snacks to remember to study the byproducts.
		KerbinInSpace = In a microgravity environment, it appears that kerbals lose kalcium from their bones.
		KerbinInSpace = Hot Pockets are sounding really good right now.
		MunInSpace = The crew thinks that the study would work better with chocoloate chip cookies.
		MinmusInSpace = Research has concluded that kerbals really like Minmus Mint ice cream.
		DunaInSpace = The crew has a hankering for pizza.

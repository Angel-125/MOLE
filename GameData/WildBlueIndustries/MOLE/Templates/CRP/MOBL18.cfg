	description = The Botany Lab is a fuel tank converted into an orbiting experimental garden to study plant growth in space. The designers originally wanted to call it the Botany Bay, but crews expressed concerns about the bay secretly holding cryopods full of genetically engineered, highly intelligent, BadS super kerbals capable of simultaneously being pilots, engineers, and scientists that would take over the space station. After numerous failed attempts to show that no secret cryopods existed, engineers relented and renamed the converted tank to the Botany Lab.

	description = When you want to haul a small amount of stuff, it's time to travel in Coach. This shipping container offers no-frills storage.

Storage items cost extra. Void where prohibited. Warranty void if removed from the VAB or SPH. Not responsible for damaged or lost goods.

	description = This kit is used to transport various science experiments to another vessel or to bring them back to Kerbin to reap the rewards. In the VAB/SPH, you can open the experiment manifest window to select one of the experiment slots, and then choose an experiment from the available list. In flight, you can transfer experiments into and out of the Coach to any part that supports an experiment manifest. If an experiment has been completed, it can only be tranfered one last time, so be sure to make the right choice. This kit can hold up to four science experiments.

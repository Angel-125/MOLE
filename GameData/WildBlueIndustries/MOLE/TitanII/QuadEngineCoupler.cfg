	description = The same bean counter at Wild Blue Industries who thought up the Interstage Adapter came up with this 2.5m quad engine coupler. Just clip one to the aft end of a Titan tank and then bolt a few engines onto it. When repeatedly interrogated, er, asked how many engine mounts it has, an engineer angrily replied, "THERE! ARE! FOUR! MOUNTS!"

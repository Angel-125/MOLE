	description = Wild Blue Industries' new Titan line of fuel tanks can store a wide variety of different resources. The Titan II "Konan" series are designed for the 2.5m standard diameter. We didn't need a bunch of studies to know that a half-sized version of the Titan II-32 would be useful, it was pretty obvious.

	RESULTS
	{
		default = Soil samples suggest some kind of volcanic activity in the distant past.
		default = These core samples seem to have two different compositions that indicate that some resources come from asteroid impacts.
		default = The core sample was contaminated, but the surrounding landscape has an interesting tectonic history. Numerous cracks in the ground indicate several faults in the area.
		default = Layers of sedimentary rock in the core sample indicate that water once flowed in this area. Perhaps there is water in an underground aquifer.
		default = This core sample has hematite spherules, popularly known as "blueberries" throughout the strata. They also taste terrible when added to pancakes.
		default = You find perchlorate salt deposits in the core sample. Perhaps there is water somewhere else in the area.
		default = The core samples contain basalt along with traces of gypsum, kieserite, opaline silica, and phyllosilicates. This seems to be pretty common for this area.
		default = A core sample from this area has a high percentage of clay.
		default = There appear to be flecks of a strange blue substance in the core samples. Spectral analysis hasn't been able to identify the substance, and it glows in certain lights.
		default = A layer of iron oxide in the core samples of this area suggests that an asteroid impacted the area.
		default = Several core samples consist of volcanic rock, suggesting volcanic activity in this region.
		default = There are traces of gold in the core sample. Gold rush, anyone?
		default = Somebody ate the core sample, it looked like layered chocolate cake.
		default = The sample has precursor chemicals necessary for life to occur. Perhaps there is some kind of life somewhere else in the region?
		default = This unassuming core sample contains rock, soil, and dust- not unlike regolith!
